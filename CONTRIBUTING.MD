## Contributing guidelines
* Before making a commit, please run `make format`. This will run clang-format over all the C source files in kernel/src.
* Large language model-generated code is **allowed**, with the condition that you do extensive testing over that code.
  You must also know how to make the LLM-generated code by yourself.

  Note: Even if LLM-generated code is allowed, please try to not use it.
